<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second-year M.Sc. student in [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) <img src='images/logo_UCAS.png' style='width: 1.1em;'> ([learn more about UCAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences)), and doing my research in [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](https://english.siat.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://english.cas.cn/).

My research interest includes machine learning and computer vision. Recently, I focus on weakly supervised learning (learning with limited and imperfect data) and its applications for science, aiming to promote the applicability and flexibility of AI algorithms in real world.

> 📢📢📢 I am looking for research internships and Ph.D. positions. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:dh.zhou@siat.ac.cn).

[Acknowledging the Unknown for Multi-label Learning with Single Positive Labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16219.pdf)

**ECCV 2022** (<font color=red>Top-tied Conf. @ CV</font>) | [[Code]](https://github.com/Correr-Zhou/SPML-AckTheUnknown) [[Slides]](resources/acktheunknown_10min_slides.pdf)
- This work focuses on single positive multi-label learning (SPML), an extreme of weakly supervised learning problem.
- we choose to treat all unannotated labels from a novel perspective, and hence propose our entropy-maximization loss (with a special gradient regime) and asymmetric pseudo-labeling (with asymmetric-tolerance strategies).
- Our method achieves SOTA results on all four SPML benchmarks and various analyses are provided to verify its effectiveness and rationality.
